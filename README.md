# Summing up
Your password "$! # Thisisverysafe" is now "41 40 20 8 9 19 9 19 22 5 18 25 19 1 6 5" (if you copy and paste into the password panel, it will also count the spaces! You can remove the spaces between the numbers, but the decryption cannot be done! (4140208919919225182519165)) Being more secure, to be able to access your accounts you will have to have access to this script, as you would have to be a robot to be able to decorate all these numbers ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯
